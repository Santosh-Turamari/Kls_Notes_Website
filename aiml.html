                <p id="m">1. Engineering knowledge: Apply the knowledge of mathematics,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;science,
                    engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; to the solution of
                    complex engineering problems.

                    <br> <br> 2. Problem analysis: Identity, formulate, review research literature, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and
                    analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;conclusions using the
                    first principles of mathematics, natural sciences, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;and engineering sciences.
                    <br> <br> 3. Design/development of solutions: Design solutions for complex engineering problems and
                    design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate consideration
                    for public health and safety and cultural, societal, and environmental considerations.
                    <br> <br> 4. Conduct investigations of complex problems: Use research-based knowledge and research
                    methods including design of experiments, analysis, interpretation of data, and synthesis of the
                    information to provide valid conclusions.
                    <br> <br> 5.Modern tool usage: Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and
                    modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modeling to complex engineering achieves
                    with an understanding of the limitations.
                    <br> <br> 6. The engineer and society: Apply to reason informed by the contextual knowledge to
                    assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities
                    relevant to the professional engineering practice.
                    <br> <br> 7. Environment and sustainability: Understand the impact of professional engineering
                    solutions in societal and environmental contexts and demonstrate the knowledge of and need for
                    sustainable development.
                    <br> <br> 8. Ethics: Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities
                    and norms of the engineering practice.
                    <br> <br> 9. Individual and team work: Function effectively as an individual and as a member or
                    leader in diverse teams and in multidisciplinary settings.
                    <br> <br> 10. Communication: Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the
                    engineering community and with society at large, such as being able to comprehend and write
                    effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations and give and receive clear
                    instructions.
                    Project management and finance: Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the engineering and
                    management principles and apply these to oneâ€™s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage
                    projects and in multidisciplinary environments.
                    <br> <br> 11. Life-long learning: Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to
                    engage in independent and life-long learning in the broadest context of technological change.
